1987,We Are Singapore,"There was a time when people said
That Singapore won’t make it, but we did
There was a time when troubles seemed too much
For us to take, but we did
We built a nation, strong and free, reaching out together
For peace and harmony
This is my country, this is my flag
This is my future, this is my life
This is my family, these are my friends
We are Singapore, Singaporeans
Singapore our homeland, it’s here that we belong
All of us united, one people marching on
We’ve come so far together, our common destiny
Singapore forever, a nation strong and free
We the citizens of Singapore
Pledge ourselves as one united people
Regardless of race, language or religion
To build a democratic society
Based on justice and equality
So as to achieve happiness
Prosperity and progress for our nation
We are Singapore, we are Singapore
We will stand together, hear the lion roar
We are Singapore, we are Singapore
We’re a nation strong and free forevermore"
1989,Five Stars Arising,"There's a new moon arising, out of the stormy sea
Youthful and bright and bearing hope, and tranquil as can be
Reach out for the moon above, savour freedom, truth and love
There's a new moon arising, out of the stormy sea
There are five stars arising, out of the stormy sea
Each is a lamp to guide our way; a lamp for all to see
Reach out for the stars above, savour freedom, truth and love
There are five stars arising, out of the stormy sea
There's a new flag arising, out of the stormy sea
Crimson as the blood of all mankind, yet white and pure and free
Reach out for the flag above, savour freedom, truth and love
There's a new flag arising, happy and proud are we"
1991,It’s the Little Things,"Over the years, I've grown to be a part of you
You've cared for me and opened the way to a happy and beautiful life
You make me feel warm and safe and give me hope for brighter days
It's the little things that we share, the love and joy that's in the air
The children's laughter everywhere, and all our favourite things
Over the years, I've grown accustomed to your ways
And no matter where I'll be, it warms my heart to know that
You're always here for me
Over the years, I've learnt we share a destiny

Cause deep down inside I feel you're a part of me
My Singapore, the place that I call my Home"
1995,My People My Home,"Who are you, my country?
More than celebrations and tears
More than memories put together
Or the summing up of years

Sunshine and storms at your heart
In your face the lines ever changing
Tell the story where I have a part
You, My people, My home
Our lives defend and uphold
May the good we achieve as one nation
Be shared with the world
As a new chapter begins
From where we have come thus far
Once again may it be written
You are who we are
In you may we see ourselves
Your needs your strength in us
That the work for freedom and peace
Is mine as much as ours
You, My people, My home
Our lives defend and uphold
May the good we achieve as one nation
Be shared with the world
May the good we achieve as one nation
Be shared with the world"

In Singapore city bus
To see Collyer Quay and Raffles Place
The Esplanade and all of us

Their hearts are big and wide you'll find
Because in Singapore, Singapore
You'll find happiness for everyone
Let's go down to the riverside, it's an unforgettable sight

For people like you and I"

2001,Where I Belong,"Morning comes around and I
Can't wait to see my sunny island
In its glorious greenery
Whether rain or shine, it's still beautiful
Bright lights shine on the streets at night
Guiding me closer to home
To a place where I'll be safe and warm
Where I belong
Friends and families by my side
Seeing me through as I grow and learn
Everyday's experience
Bitter, sweet or sour, they are still wonderful
As they become precious memories
They'll be kept close to my heart
And no matter where I am I will always know
Where I belong
Where I belong
Where I keep my heart and soul
Where dreams come true for us
Where we walk together hand in hand
Towards a future so bright
Where I belong
Where I keep my heart and soul
Where we are one big family
I want the whole world to know
I want to shout it out loud
That this is where I know I belong"
2002,We Will Get There,"Remember the days, we set out together with faith?
Remember the times, so fine, when we thought that
Nothing could stand in our way?
Then things weren't the same, the life that we knew had to change
We've struggled through, the darkest storms
We thought we couldn't tame
Together we've tried, as we stood side by side
I knew we'd build a new world
A world of hope for ever after
Deep in my heart I just know
Right from the start, we will grow
Look where we are, we've come so far
And there's still a long, long way to go
With all of my heart, I will care
I'll play my part, I will share
With family and friends, together we'll stand
And in the end, hand in hand
We will get there
So now we begin, working together to win
Believing in trust, it must
Be possible to overcome anything
There's so much to do, there's so much we can contribute
By sharing just a little love
We will start again anew
So why don't we try? If we stand side by side
I know we'll build a new world
A world of hope for ever after
Deep in my heart I just know
Right from the start, we will grow
Look where we are, we've come so far
And there's still a long, long way to go"

She’s everything to me
Grace and beauty
In all that you see
My island home

Nor will she forget me
And I will sing
A song of home
A land of peace
Where dreams are born everyday

2007,There's No Place I'd Rather Be,"I’ve walked the streets of Cairo & Bombay
I’ve seen the neon signs on old Broadway
I’ve climbed the Eiffel Tower
The Great Wall in one hour
Experienced Sweet and Sour
But that’s okay
Seen Hollywood, the sunsets in LA
The London Bridge, Big Ben, the Thames, UK
I’ve crossed the River Kwai
Yet still I don’t know why
I think of you each night and every day
There’s no place I’d rather be
You’ll always be a part of me
And even though I’ve roamed the world
It’s still my home I long to see
This is where my family
And my friends grew up with me
So I’ll cross the skies and sail the seas
To be where I wanna be
There’s no place I’d rather be
You’ll always be a part of me
And even though I’ve roamed the world
It’s still my home I long to see
This is where my family
And my friends grow old with me
So I’ll cross the skies and sail the seas
To be where I wanna be
Cos there’s no place I’d rather be"
2007,Will You,"Will you make this island
Amazing in all ways?
Surprises every corner,
Delightful nights and days.
Will you take this country
And turn it from a place
To a home that greets you
With smiles on every face?
Will you come on this brave journey?
Will you help to make it real?
Will you write us grand new stories,
Songs that everyone will feel?
Will you swim the current?

2009,What Do You See,"There’s a jewel on the ocean,
a gem upon the sea
Where the future is an open book
A land of destiny
We could set our sights into the wind and sail the seven seas
or climb the highest mountain top as long as we believe
What do you see? What do you see?
See the moon and the stars, look how far we have come
Look around at our faces, they shine brightly in the sun
With our hopes and dreams, imagine what tomorrow it may bring
What do you see? What do you see?
Now the time has come to reach out,
To open up to see
That we stand together in this land
Cos we are family
As thoughts of reaching to the sky are carried on a dream
With hearts and minds united, our dreams we will achieve
What do you see? What do you see?
See the moon and the stars, look how far we have come
Look around at our faces, they shine brightly in the sun
With our hopes and dreams, imagine what tomorrow it may bring
What do you see
What do you see when life makes you take on a mountain
Youll see that nothings gonna stand in your way
Together we can share
The strength of a million
and the courage of a million more
See the moon and the stars, look how far we have come
Look around at our faces, they shine brightly in the sun
With our hopes and dreams, imagine what tomorrow it may bring
Cos the skys the only limit when youre not afraid to dream
What do you see? What do you see"

Rolls across my peaceful isle
Mornings, I wake up, refreshed, renewed
Ready to meet the bright new day
So much to look forward to
Daylight
The city has stirred to life
Your smiles
Put a spring in my step
There's a feeling that binds us one and all
Different stories, shared memories
I love my city's lively ways
Warm sunny days
Sights and sounds, special tastes
That add up to this place
I love my friends, my closest ties
Now I finally realize
When it feels this right
You know that it's love at first light
Night fall, stars twinkling on the bay
My dreams can take flight if I dare
There's a feeling that binds us one and all
We look forward to a brighter day
Hand in hand, we'll find new strength
And see our dreams take flight in Singapore

You know that it's
Love at first light"

we've moved ahead together
We've built a brave new world
where we could shine and grow
Ohh..And now we only have
to look towards tomorrow
To carry on the dream
as far as it will go
So now we look around us and we see
A nation built with love by you and me
A land to treasure
right down to the core
Our home, our heart, our Singapore
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Our home,our heart, our SINGAPORE
To my people of the future
We built it for the ones that dream
Hand in hand we make our land
Our home, the place to be
From young to Gold,
Our stories unfold,
Moments like these will speak
Words that last forever,
Worlds that come together
To show that we're all the same
We'll break the chains,to make a change
Burn bright,Our lion city flame
And amazing as it seems
It all started with a dream
But the dreaming isn't done
Coz the best is yet to come
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Our home, our heart, our SINGAPORE
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Our home, our heart, our SINGAPORE Deep in my heart I just know
Right from the start, we will grow
Look where we are,we've come so far
And there's still a long, long way to go
With all of my heart, I will care
I'll play my part, I will share
With family and friends,
together we'll stand
And in the end,hand in hand
We will get there
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Our home,
Our heart,
Our dream."
2020,Everything I Am,"I want you to understand
Because of you, I am who I am
Because of who you are
I can be everything I am
Show me how I should be strong
Teach me that I can be weak
Because of who you are
I can find anything I seek
And in each other, there will be
The colours of your tapestry
Colours you’ve never seen
Here’s to my home, to my homeland
To every shining crystal in the sand
Because of who you are
I can be everything I am
Here’s to you, to my homeland
I hold this precious jewel in my hand
Because of who you are
I can be everything I am
Teacher, teach me to be kind
Quick to embrace
And slow to close my mind
If we reach that star
We’ll have the universe in time
And in each other, there will be
The fabric of our destiny
It’s more than you and me
Here’s to my home, to my homeland
A sea of shining crystals in the sand
Because of who you are
I can be everything I am
Here’s to you, Singapore (homeland)
Here’s to my people I could want nothing more
Here’s to you, Singapore (homeland)
We hold this precious jewel in our hands
Because of who you are
Because of who you are
I can be everything I am"
